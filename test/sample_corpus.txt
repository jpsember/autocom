We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand well out towards
the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town.
We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by -- that was the town, you know
-- and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a
mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain
and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to both stay on
watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and
turned in for the night. It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned
in anyway if I'd had a bed, because a body don't see such a storm as that every day
in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every
second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around,
and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around
in the wind; then comes a h-whack! -- bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum -- and the
thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit -- and then rip comes another flash
and another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't any
clothes on, and didn't mind. We didn't have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring
and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her
head this way or that and miss them.
